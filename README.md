# Incredibox
A source code of Incredibox extracted from Android app

You can run it on apache, nginx or any other web server.
The Android version has same assets as PC version.
All the differences are made with js/main.min.js but I couldn't make the PC version
work since it needs electron to run and the script is huge.
